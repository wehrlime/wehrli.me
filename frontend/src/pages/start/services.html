    <h3>Tailor-made Management Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      I build tailor-made web platforms to manage any kind of data in an intuitive and user friendly
      way. DNP, CDP, CMS, CRM, ERP or fully custom management solutions. You name it, I can build
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By analysing your business needs and building a custom management system, there are virtually
      no limits on what can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      No third party solutions that are costly to integrate and maintain or require expensive
      external personnel. My solutions are thoroughly thought through, extensible, tested and
      documented. You stay flexible and own the software code to do with it as you please.

    <h3>Websites</h3>
    <p>
      I build your new website from an existing design or create a fitting design myself. I connect
      it to a modern CMS system or any existing or new management system and set it up on your
      servers or your webspace. I will consult you in choosing a good domain name and assist in
      obtaining a webspace or managed cloud server.
    </p>
    <p>
      An informative and attractive website with good user experience is your most important
      marketing instrument. It gives your business identity and credibility and makes your company
      and your services visible and accessible to your audience.

    <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
    <p>I build your cross-platform mobile app to your specifications.</p>
    <p>
      Mobile apps which tap into the data of new or existing management systems are a modern
      approach to improve any aspect your business. Refine the workflow of your employees or create
      communication channels with your clients or customers. Unlimited possibilities.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Connected Systems</h3>
    <p>
      I build custom systems consisting of websites, mobile apps and management systems. That way,
      your data is located in one central place, instead of scattered across multiple systems and
      platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power of your data should be harnessed for your business success. Good structured data is
      key to gaining valuable information from it. Don't let chaos in your data reduce your
      potential.

    <h3>Freelancing</h3>
    <p>Do you need more manpower in your project?</p>

    <h3>Codebase Audits</h3>
    <p>
      I analyse and audit existing codebases, developed by your internal or external partners. With
      focus on maintainability and overall code quality I write an extensive report on possibilities
      on how to improve and on what to keep an eye on in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software code can get complex and confusing very fast. Developers are often blind to their own
      shortcomings, which makes it vulnerable. This is why periodic code audits are a must to keep
      your software maintainable and to prevent your code from bringing your business to a halt.
