    <h3>Data Management Systems</h3>
    <p>
      I build tailor-made systems to import, record, maintain, analyse and export any kind of your
      business data.
    </p>
    <p>
      By analysing your business needs and requirements and then building a custom system, there are
      virtually no limits, on what can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      No third party solutions that are costly to integrate and maintain. My solutions are
      thoroughly thought through, extensible, tested and documented. You stay flexible and own the
      software code, to do with it as you please in the future.

      I build your new website from existing Designs and Wireframes, connect it to a CMS system or

    <h3>Connected Systems</h3>
    <p>
      I build all-encompassing system landscapes consisting of websites, mobile apps and data
      management systems. In that way, your data is in one central place, instead of scattered
      across multiple systems and platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power of your data should be used for your business success. Don't let chaos in your data
      reduce your success.

    <h3>Codebase Audits</h3>
    <p>
      Software code can get complex and confusing very fast. Developers are often blind to their own
      shortcomings concerning their code, which makes it vulnerable. This is why periodic code
      audits are a must, to keep your software maintainable and to prevent your code on bringing
      your business to a halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I analyse and audit existing codebases, developed by your internal or external partners, with
      focus on maintainability and overall code quality and write an extensive report on
      possibilities on how to improve and on what to think about in the future.
