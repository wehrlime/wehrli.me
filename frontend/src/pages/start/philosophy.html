<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p class="lead">I operate with a certain philosophy and with standards to myself.</p>
<br />
<div class="boxes">
  <div class="box">
    <h3>My client owns my output</h3>
    <p>
      Many contractors produce software which they license to the client for usage, but is
      ultimately owned by the contractor. I do not operate like this. Everything I produce during my
      relationship with a client, is the clients property. This has many benefits for both the
      client and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It allows the client, for example, to be flexible with their software, rearrange project
      organisation and even cut me out of the mix entirely, if necessary, without losing their
      software. Depending on the scale of a growing project, I will even advise such a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it allows me to stay flexible with my time and the amount of projects I
      tackle, without having to worry about running out of resources.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>I communicate often</h3>
    <p>I believe, that communication is the key to success. I pride myself in full transparency.</p>
    <p>
      This is why I communicate often via instant messages, status reports, emails or calls. If
      conditions change or things do not go as planned, the client and I need to resolve these
      issues quickly, so that the project timeline can be adjusted.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>I am honest</h3>
    <p>
      I do not lie about anything, to gain an advantage. My time estimates, my progress reports, my
      communication, what I say I will be able to do, all is honest. If estimates turn out to be
      wrong, either to much or too little, if there appear unforseen circumstances or if there are
      any other issues, i will communicate immediately.
    </p>
    <p>In turn, I expect my clients to be honest as well.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>I work with full capacity</h3>
    <p>
      For me, software is not something, that can be produced with half capacity. During the time I
      work on software, it has my full attention. That way I can guarantee the best possible
      outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      In turn this means, that all information that I need to complete a project must be present
      prior to me starting. If I have to constantly collect information while I try to produce
      software, the quality will inadventently suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also means, that I do not calculate a productivity factor. An hour spent with me is an hour
      I will dedicate to the project. Breaks, calls with family, walking the dog will not be
      calculated into the mix. This means, my hourly rate is fair, both to the client and to me.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>I work with people</h3>
    <p>
      But I don't work <strong>for</strong> people. A classical client-contractor relationship is
      not for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in a cooperative and supporting work environment. This is the only possible breeding
      ground for the successful outcome of any project.
