<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p class="lead">
  Atwood's Law states, that "Any application that <i>can</i> be written in JavaScript,
  <i>will</i> eventually be written in JavaScript".
</p>
<br />
<p class="max-width-900">I support this hypothesis.</p>
<p class="max-width-900">
  JavaScript enables good user experience on the internet. It is accessible for everyone, runs in
  every browser on any computer and smartphone. Secure by default, no installation needed.
</p>
<p class="max-width-900">
  This is why JavaScript and the technologies that emerged from it, like TypeScript, SPA frameworks
  and Node.js, are in my opinion the most important development that has happened to software
  engineering in the last three decades.
</p>
<p class="max-width-900">
  I solely rely on technologies that emerged from JavaScript, when building software.

      <h3>Front-end</h3>
      <p>
        The front-end of a web application are the parts, which are executed within a browser.
        Either on a computer or on a smartphone. Users can interact with it and it loosely connects
        via so called APIs to the back-end, to fetch data from and sends data to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the front-end <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" title="Angular">Angular</a>,
        <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" title="React">React</a> and
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" title="Vue.js">Vue.js</a>
        are some of the technologies I use.

      <h3>Mobile apps</h3>
      <p>
        Mobile apps can be built with multiple technologies. Either native Apps in Java/Kotlin for
        Android or Objective-C/Swift for iOS. Native apps have the downside, that they have to be
        built twice. Once for each operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I use JavaScript technologies, I use
        <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank" title="Ionic Framework"
          >Ionic Framework</a
        >,
        <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank" title="React Native">React Native</a> or
        <a href="https://nativescript.org/" target="_blank" title="NativeScript">NativeScript</a>
        instead, which are so called hybrid app frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest advantage of these frameworks is, that only one app needs to be built to support
        both iOS and Android. You are able to cut your timely and costly needs in half and only need
        one team to maintain the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well made hybrid apps are indistinguishable from native apps. Some well known hybrid apps
        are Gmail, Uber, Facebook or Instagram.

      <h3>Web server</h3>
      <p>
        As web server technology I use
        <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank" title="Nginx">Nginx</a> or
        <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank" title="Apache">Apache</a> and Linux as
        operating system, depending on the available server.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Node.js process management I use
        <a href="https://pm2.keymetrics.io/" target="_blank" title="pm2">pm2</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For scalable back-ends I use

      <h3>Back-end</h3>
      <p>
        The back-end is the part on a web application, which is executed on a server. It computes
        data, reads and writes to databases and is responsible to do things, that can not or should
        not be done in the front-end. Like, for example, user authentication.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the back-end I use JavaScript/TypeScript as well. Here these languages are used within
        <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" title="Node.js">Node.js</a>, which is a
        runtime environment, that can execute
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript"
          >JavaScript</a
        >
        like a Browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Node.js framework I use
        <a href="https://nestjs.com/" target="_blank" title="NestJS">NestJS</a> or "plain" Node.js
        with <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" title="Express.js">Express.js</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Node.js headless CMS' I use are
        <a href="https://strapi.io/" target="_blank" title="Strapi">Strapi</a> and
        <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" title="Ghost">Ghost</a>. The choice on which
        CMS to use varies between use cases.

      <h3>Database</h3>
      <p>
        To use relational database systems is the first choice for me. With SQL-like systems data
        relations can be depicted within the database structure, which makes the data more rigid.
        But if the use cases dictates it, I use key-value databases (noSQL) as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I rely on ORMs (Object-relational mapper) like
        <a href="https://www.prisma.io/" target="_blank" title="Prisma">Prisma</a>,
        <a href="https://mikro-orm.io/" target="_blank" title="MikroORM">MikroORM</a> or
        <a href="https://typeorm.io/" target="_blank" title="TypeORM">TypeORM</a>.<br />Theses ORMs
        can manage a diverse range of databases, like
        <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank" title="SQLite">SQLite</a>,
        <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank" title="MySQL">MySQL</a>,
        <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank" title="MongoDB">MongoDB</a>,

        <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" title="Redis">Redis</a> and more.
