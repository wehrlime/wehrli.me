<h2>About me</h2>
<p class="lead">
  With more than 10 years of experience in conceptualizing, developing and integrating software, I
  am your ideal partner in programming your next software product.
</p>
<h3>Beginnings and apprenticeship</h3>
<p>
  I started my software engineering journey in school, where I teached myself the basics of
  programming, operating systems and information technology in general. My first website in basic
  HTML and CSS was created during that time.
</p>
<p>
  This sparked my fascination for IT and my dedication, to graduate a 4 year apprenticeship as a
  computer scientist with specialization in software engineering. Besides a lot of IT basics, I
  learned more about software engineering and programming languages during that time.
</p>
<p>
  My focus while at the office was C#, WPF and YAML. But during my free time I already created
  Websites for friends and family with PHP, JavaScript and Wordpress and expanded my knowledge in
  software engineering for the web.
</p>
<h3>Agency experience</h3>
<p>
  After my apprenticeship I landed a Job at a web agency in ZÃ¼rich. There I learned more about
  JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS and about conceptualizing and developing corporate websites for
  renowned Swiss companies.<br />There my enthusiasm for front end web engineering was sparked,
  which motivated me, to start larger scale software projects in my spare time. Coding started to
  become a large part of my life and I was constantly hacking on some side project.
</p>
<p>
  Also during that time, I started to study business informatics parallel to work. There I learned
  all the aspects needed, to lead IT projects to success. I successfully completed my studies at the
  end of 2019.
</p>
<h3>Eventfrog</h3>
<p>
  In 2020 I desired to change jobs and had the luck, to land one as a front end and app developer at
  Eventfrog.
</p>
<p>
  Eventfrog's goal is to revolutionize the event ticketing market by offering a self-service
  ticketing platform. Here I had the opportunity, to deepen my SPA framework knowledge, mainly in
  Angular, and my hybrid mobile app skills in Ionic.
</p>
<p>I was involved in</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>cleaning up and extending the self-service ticketing platform</p></li>
  <li><p>cleaning up and extending the ticket buyer app</p></li>
  <li><p>rebuilding the shop checkout from scratch</p></li>
  <li><p>rebuilding the admission control app from scratch</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      adapting the Covid SDK of the Swiss government from Kotlin into TypeScript and integrating it
      into the admission control app, to check Covid Passes at the venue entrances
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      implementing Eventfrog Cashless, a way to pay for drinks and merch at the venue with TWINT
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>and more I probably already forgot. ðŸ˜Š</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Now</h3>
<p>
  During all the years and the different challenges my desire to be self-employed was growing.
  Beeing slowed down by companies' inefficiencies and politics was something, I always shied away
  from.
</p>
<p>
  This is why, you are able to now hire me as a versatile and battle-proofed software engineer,
  which has seen many sides of how to lead software projects and develop robust, maintainable and
  scalable software.
